# Hero randomizer assignment

i have created Swift `UIKit` single-page application, but without storyboard.
UI is implemented using `UIHostingController` which presents `SwiftUI` content

i have researched the api and made desicion to fetch once onAppear and then just change the selectedHero
so that the api calls will be eliminated increasing speed and network optimization

i wanted to show heroes as a list or swipable elements because on my opinion showing specs of random heroes is useless.
